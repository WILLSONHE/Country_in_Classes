Data files are very common in many disciplines. They form the input for a variety of different kinds of processing, analysis, summaries, etc. An associated problem is to maintain these data files – to add information, update or correct information.

A common approach is to use a program – an update program that takes a data file and a file of updates and then creates a new version of the data file with the updates applied.
